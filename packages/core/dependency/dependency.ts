/**
 * Creates the default service dependency graph.
 *
 * @remarks
 * One graph per provider instance is intentional: `ProgressManager` carries
 * per-job state, so sharing it across providers would interleave progress from
 * unrelated jobs. The graph itself is cheap because the undici connection pools
 * underneath it are process-wide and shared (see `BaseHttpClient`), which is what
 * previously leaked six pools per provider construction.
 *
 * @returns Default service dependencies
